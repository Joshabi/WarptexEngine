# Warptex Engine
This was originally a Year 2 University Project that I have since majorly refactored and decided to re-publish.
It is a basic C++-based SDL2 setup for making Bullet Hell Patterning and Gameplay, designed to be somewhat
flexible with configurable pattern generation and loading pattern designs from dat files.

Not all features have been ported or refactored yet, so a lot of features are currently missing.
### Currently reimplementing:
- Loading Patterns from config files
- Menu Functionality

### I would like to implement:
- Generic GameObject Object pooling.
- Improved collision tag matrix for determining which objects can collide with one-another.
- Improved collision efficiency by using spatial partitioning techniques.
- Scheduling system for tasks
